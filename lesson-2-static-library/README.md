# Lesson 1 - Hello World and Makefile

Here we print a hello world in console with C++ standard library besides that we use makefile for building the executable;

## usage

just run make

```bash
make 
```

## Some important notes

### g++ compiler options

* -pedantic: Enables a strict interpretation of the ANSI C Standard. Compile with -pedantic -W -Wall if you want gcc to nag you about sloppy programming.
